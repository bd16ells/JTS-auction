# JTS-auction
My *Journey Through Sping* represented by an Auction application. This project uses a restful API and follows Domain Driven Design. The aggregage entity is an Auction, and it has Bids relating to it. This project shows my learning of Spring Boot, including things such as Beans, Aspects, Resources, Proxies, Security, an Event driven system, and more. I also dabbled with RabbitMQ.
